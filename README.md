## 2. Core Features & Architecture

### 2.1 The Command Center (Dashboard)
The Dashboard is the first screen users see. It is engineered for "Zero-Click Latency" — all critical information is visible immediately without navigation.

#### **A. Global Market Watch**
*Real-time pulse of the global indices.*
*   **Feature:** Tracks major global indices (GIFT Nifty, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, DAX, Nikkei) in real-time.
*   **User Value:** Traders get an immediate specialized view of global sentiment before the Indian market opens.
*   **Visuals:** Color-coded heatmaps and sparklines for instant trend recognition.

#### **B. Market Wire (News Feed)**
*The narrative behind the numbers.*
*   **Feature:** Aggregated news feed from top financial sources, filtered for relevance to the Indian Forex and Equity markets.
*   **User Value:** Saves users from tab-switching. They get breaking news headlines as they happen, contextualized alongside price action.

#### **C. Live Market Scanner**
*The hunter-seeker algorithm.*
*   **Feature:** An algorithmic scanner that identifies breakouts, volume shocks, and technical patterns (e.g., "Gap Up", "52W High") in real-time.
*   **User Value:** Automates the "hunting" process. Instead of scanning 500 charts, the user sees the top 5 emerging opportunities instantly.

### 2.2 The Economic Calendar (The Core USP)
This is not just a list of dates; it is the **strategic backbone** of the platform for Forex traders.

*   **Feature:** A highly detailed timeline of global economic events (fed rates, non-farm payrolls, RBI announcements, inflation data).
*   **Impact Analysis:** Each event is tagged with its potential impact level (High/Medium/Low) and the specific currency pairs/sectors it will affect.
*   **Consensus vs. Actual:** Displays the 'Forecast' vs. 'Actual' data points, allowing traders to trade the variance instantly.
*   **Smart Filtering:** Users can filter by country (USD, INR, EUR) or impact, ensuring they don't miss "Black Swan" events.
*   **User Value:** Fundamental analysis made accessible. Traders can plan their week around these volatility events.

### 2.3 The Forum & Community System

#### **A. Dynamic Threading**
*   **Feature:** A sleek, dark-mode interface similar to Discord/Slack but structured for financial threads.
*   **Innovation:** "Chat-Style" View. Users land on the latest activity (bottom of the thread) and scroll up for history, mirroring modern social habits.
*   **Key Function:** Supports rich text, tagging ($NIFTY, #Bullish), and direct replies.
